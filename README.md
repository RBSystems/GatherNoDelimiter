GatherNoDelimiter
=================

SIMPL+ Module for concatenating a string without a delimiter.

This module is intended to be used with an SIO symbol when handling communication with a device that provices serial feedback that the Crestron hardware has a difficult time concatenating on it's own, and the device's serial communications do not include a standardized delimiter.

The module is simple, with one input and one output.  If you're feeling whimsical, you can turn debug on.
